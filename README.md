### Hey there 👋 Smile please 😁

I'm a 16-year-old in high school. I'm damn passionate about building stuff that solve people's problems. Hence, with my project [GamifyingEdu](https://github.com/JaPatGitHub/GamifyingEdu), I'm currently working to solve a problem I myself face - boring teaching methods at school which makes learning feel pointless to students.

I'm currently learning JavaScript with a focus on creative coding and physics simulations in [p5.js](https://p5js.org). I also know some python. I plan to further extend my skills in  Web Development & Machine Learning. I'm an open-source enthusiast and currently contribute to [Exercism](https://exercism.org). 

PS: Feel free to email me at japrad26@gmail.com. Would love to talk!!
